# Notes:

#### Unforeseen issues and questions during the development process

######  Angular project: https://github.com/juliajessica/nurture-funding

* I did not run into any issues while working on this independent project. I found that React is a fairly simple library to use. Linter always saves the day anytime you forget a semicolon but other then small little typos I did not have any issues building this application.

* Oh, I lied -- I'm not sure how to get SVG's to work using React! If you have any insight please do share.

#### Thoughts on the difference in development process in Angular and React

* The development processes seems easier to me in React than in  Angular. It could also be because Angular was the first time we were introduced to larger applications and learning how to move data up/down. I enjoy using props and routing in one component. Its feels more organized to me having all of my functionality spread out into smaller functions.
