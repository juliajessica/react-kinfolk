    fullDetails: 'Introducing The Paris Issue: This spring, we visit Paris and explore one of the world’s most iconic cities through the Kinfolk lens, examining the essence of joie de vivre and how it translates into life outside the French capital. We spend a day in the Marais with Ramdane Touhami, the energetic entrepreneur behind L’Officine Universelle Buly, pay a visit to the modernist pied-à-terre of Emmanuel de Bayser, pore over the archives at Hermès, and meet a diverse roster of Parisians that have made their city one of our favorites. Elsewhere in Issue Twenty-Seven, we meet musician Benjamin Clementine, delve into the life and work of artist Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian in Tehran, drill into subjects such as loneliness, the dead of night and true grit, speak to fashion designer Khalid Al Qasimi and meet dancers Akram Khan and Michaela Prince, plus much more.'

Inside, we explore the sporting life among the rolling hills of rural England with an equestrian-themed feature profile in the Cotswolds and a longform essay by David Sedaris. We also mine a history of bad dieting advice, play gymnastics with men’s fashion and have some fun in Hollywood with a glamorous water ballet troupe. Elsewhere, our roster of regular features includes a day in the life of Spanish designer Paloma Lanna, a feature interview with musician Kilo Kish, and reportage on the work of photographer Gordon Parks and the hidden culinary talents of journalist Lee Miller. Plus, interviews with Omar Souleyman, Siri Hustvedt and Daniela Soto-Innes.'

    fullDetails: 'The latest issue celebrates food as a lens through which identity and relationships can be interpreted. What does a person’s approach to food tell us about their values? As MFK Fisher famously wrote, sharing a meal can be more intimate than sharing a bed. Inside, we speak to culinary legend Martha Stewart, celebrate some decidedly non-essential food reading, from the electric terrines and microwaved hot dogs of ’70s-era Betty Crocker to the Toffee and Pine Cones whipped up by Salvador Dalí, visit chef Camille Becerra in Manhattan and learn about an intricately stylized and traditional Japanese method of food wrapping. Elsewhere, we meet burgeoning actor Lola Kirke, examine whether narcissism is truly a growing social concern or yet another way to silence people and learn what mundane personal habits reveal about our characters.'

Whether romantic or platonic, new or life-long, hot, cold or ambivalent, each has carefully formed subtleties and undercurrents to unpack. In this issue, we examine the moral complexities behind telling lies, explore the reassurance inherent in non-verbal communication and meet a diverse and inspiring cross-section of lovers, siblings and families, uncovering what it really means to be in a relationship.'

Rather than advising how to fill 48 hours, the issue offers insight into why we should fill our weekends, and how doing so can lead to personal fulfillment. With a dynamic mix of long-form journalism, interviews and shorter essays, plus concept-driven visual stories and contributors across the globe, the forthcoming issue of Kinfolk continues to dedicate its editorial to exploring personal values and quality of life. From the curious cultural mythologies behind sleep and fashion editorial for looking good on laundry day to interviews with Moses Sumney, Dimore Studio and more, this issue will inspire readers with a fresh outlook on going off-duty.'
